					<p>I support this decision because slaves aren’t legally allowed to bring a lawsuit against their masters and because it would set a bad precedent for slave rights.</p>

					<p>I don’t support this decision because I lived in a free state, which should make me free, and because slavery shouldn’t still exist in a nation “all men are created equal.”</p>
