			<h2>Your Role</h2>
							<div class="role rolebox">
				<div class="image"><img src="images/DredScott.jpg"></div>
				<div class="name">Dred Scott</div>
				<div class="desc"><p>As Dred Scott, you were born a slave in Virginia around 1800. In the 1830s, you were taken by your master to territories in the Upper Midwest. When you married your wife Harriet, also a slave, your master purchased Harriet and then owned the two children you had together. Your master died in 1843 and your mistress moved you and your family to St. Louis, where you petitioned for your freedom in 1846.</p></div>
